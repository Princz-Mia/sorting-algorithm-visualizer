                        Bitonic sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that can be run in parallel. It focuses on converting a random sequence of numbers into a bitonic sequence, one that monotonically increases, then decreases. Rotations of a bitonic sequence are also bitonic. More specifically, bitonic sort can be modelled as a type of sorting network. The initial unsorted sequence enters through input pipes, where a series of comparators switch two entries to be in either increasing or decreasing order.

                        The algorithm, created by Ken Batcher in 1968, consists of two parts. First, the unsorted sequence is built into a bitonic sequence; then, the series is split multiple times into smaller sequences until the input is in sorted order.

The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not considered useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.

                        Two versions of this algorithm exist: a deterministic version that enumerates all permutations until it hits a sorted one, and a randomized version that randomly permutes its input. An analogy for the working of the latter version is to sort a deck of cards by throwing the deck into the air, picking the cards up at random, and repeating the process until the deck is sorted. Its name is a portmanteau of the words bogus and sort.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps had to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up to the top of the list.

                        This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.

                        Gnome sort (nicknamed stupid sort) is a variation of the insertion sort sorting algorithm that does not use nested loops. Gnome sort was originally proposed by Iranian computer scientist Hamid Sarbazi-Azad (professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Sharif University of Technology) in 2000. The sort was first called stupid sort (not to be confused with bogosort), and then later described by Dick Grune and named gnome sort.

                        Gnome sort performs at least as many comparisons as insertion sort and has the same asymptotic run time characteristics. Gnome sort works by building a sorted list one element at a time, getting each item to the proper place in a series of swaps. The average running time is O(n2) but tends towards O(n) if the list is initially almost sorted.

                        Dick Grune described the sorting method with the following story:

                        \s\s\s\sGnome Sort is based on the technique used by the standard Dutch
                        \s\s\s\sGarden Gnome (Du.: tuinkabouter). Here is how a garden gnome
                        \s\s\s\ssorts a line of flower pots. Basically, he looks at the flower pot next to
                        \s\s\s\shim and the previous one; if they are in the right order he steps one
                        \s\s\s\spot forward, otherwise, he swaps them and steps one pot backward.
                        \s\s\s\sBoundary conditions: if there is no previous pot, he steps forwards; if
                        \s\s\s\sthere is no pot next to him, he is done.

                        In computer science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort,heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region. Unlike selection sort, heapsort does not waste time with a linear-time scan of the unsorted region; rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted region in a heap data structure to more quickly find the largest element in each step.

                        Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case O(n log n) runtime (and as such is used by Introsort as a fallback should it detect that quicksort is becoming degenerate). Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort.

                        Heapsort was invented by J. W. J. Williams in 1964. This was also the birth of the heap, presented already by Williams as a useful data structure in its own right. In the same year, Robert W. Floyd published an improved version that could sort an array in-place, continuing his earlier research into the treesort algorithm.

A pancake number is the minimum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes. In this form, the problem was first discussed by American geometer Jacob E. Goodman. A variant of the problem is concerned with burnt pancakes, where each pancake has a burnt side and all pancakes must, in addition, end up with the burnt side on bottom.

                        All sorting methods require pairs of elements to be compared. For the traditional sorting problem, the usual problem studied is to minimize the number of comparisons required to sort a list. The number of actual operations, such as swapping two elements, is then irrelevant. For pancake sorting problems, in contrast, the aim is to minimize the number of operations, where the only allowed operations are reversals of the elements of some prefix of the sequence. Now, the number of comparisons is irrelevant.

It is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. Overall, it is slightly faster than merge sort and heapsort for randomized data, particularly on larger distributions.

                        Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

                        Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. Most implementations of quicksort are not stable, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.

Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

                        The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

                        The time efficiency of selection sort is quadratic, so there are a number of sorting techniques which have better time complexity than selection sort.

The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. By starting with far apart elements, it can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange. Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959. The running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. For many practical variants, determining their time complexity remains an open problem.

                        It is important to get the integer sort size used in the recursive calls by rounding the 2/3 upwards, e.g. rounding 2/3 of 5 should give 4 rather than 3, as otherwise the sort can fail on certain data.

                        Three-way Merge Sort, also known as Ternary Merge Sort, is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input into three sublists, recursively sorts each sublist, and then merges them back together. It focuses on converting a random sequence of numbers into three sorted sublists, which are then merged to obtain the final sorted output.

                        The algorithm, created by an unknown author, consists of the following steps:
                        \s\s1. Divide the input sequence into three equal or nearly equal parts.
                        \s\s2. Recursively sort each sublist until they are sufficiently small to be directly

                        \s\s3. Merge the three sorted sublists into a single sorted list by comparing the\s
                        \s\s\s\s\s\selements at corresponding positions and placing them in the correct order.

                        Timsort is a hybrid, stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming language. The algorithm finds subsequences of the data that are already ordered (runs) and uses them to sort the remainder more efficiently. This is done by merging runs until certain criteria are fulfilled. Timsort has been Python's standard sorting algorithm since version 2.3. It is also used to sort arrays of non-primitive type in Java SE 7, on the Android platform, in GNU Octave, on V8, Swift, and Rust.

                        It uses techniques from Peter McIlroy's 1993 paper "Optimistic Sorting and Information Theoretic Complexity".
